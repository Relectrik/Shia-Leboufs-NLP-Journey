"As I walked through the forest, I didnâ€™t notice anything unusual until my phone died. Suddenly, I heard footsteps getting closer. Looking over my shoulder, I saw someone following me about thirty feet behind. He was running towards me like he had some kind of plan. ","Uhh, maybe I should start running too!","('anticipation', 0.7073690295219421)"
"The person got down on all fours and started breaking into a sprint. ""What the heck is that?"" I thought. He was gaining on me really fast. ","Luckily, I'm Barry Allen, the fastest man alive.","('optimism', 0.9638476371765137)"
"I looked for my car but realized I was completely lost. He was almost upon me now. There was blood on his face. ""Oh my god, there's blood everywhere!"" I yelled. ","Why are you ignoring the fact that I am the Flash. Shia is done for,.","('anger', 0.9789239764213562)"
"Running for my life (from Shia), he was brandishing a knife. ""It's Shia,"" I thought. Lurking in the shadows, Hollywood superstar Shia Labeouf. Killing for sport, eating all the bodies. Now it was dark, and I seemed to have lost him. But then I heard a faint sound coming from the cottage nearby. Hope! Moving quietly, I crept toward it. But my leg was stuck in a bear trap! G-n-a-w-ting off my leg, quietly. Limping toward the cottage, quietly. Now I was sitting inside, sharpening an ax. But he didn't hear me come in. Strangling superstar Shia Labeouf? Fighting for my life, wrestling a knife from him, stabbing it in his kidney. Safe at last from Shia. ",I am the Flash! Acknowledge me.,"('optimism', 0.5268831253051758)"
"I limped into the dark woods, blood oozing from my stump leg. But I had won. I had beaten Shia Labeouf. And now I knew who I could rely on when things got crazy. ","Ok Qwen, you have to take the player's repsonses into account","('anticipation', 0.5841050148010254)"
